    """
    Calculate the number of hydrogen stations needed for a given scenario year based on the percentage of three brands of trucks.

    Args:
        df (pandas.DataFrame): The input dataframe with the traffic data for each region.
        daimler_perc (float): The percentage of Daimler trucks in the scenario (between 0 and 1).
        nikola_perc (float): The percentage of Nikola trucks in the scenario (between 0 and 1).
        daf_perc (float): The percentage of DAF trucks in the scenario (between 0 and 1).
        year (int): The year of the scenario.
